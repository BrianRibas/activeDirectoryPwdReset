This program was built with Python to reset username accounts within 
Active Directory. It retrieves the data from a csv file. The csv file
will not be posted here due to ppi information, however feel free to create 
your own csv file. 

Requirements:
import subprocess module to run and invoke ps cmdlets;
import csv module to extract data from the csv file with username data
